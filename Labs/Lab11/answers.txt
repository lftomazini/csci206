1.1 over1 When entering a string with more than 10 characters it prints the exact sanme string as input.
    over2 When entering a string with more than 10 characters it prints truncating after the 9th character.
    The buffer overflow risk was eliminated by using the fgets function, which has as an argument the size of the buffer.

1.2 It does not check for the size of the buffer, using only the scanf function. This way it might overwrite other data.

1.3 The program must always check if the input string can be stored in the buffer. Must remember about the '\0' character. So for a buffer of size n, there must be a check if the input string is n-1 in size or smaller. If it is not the programmer must provide a solution, such as truncate or ask for another string.

1.4 To avoid buffer overflow it is possible to store only the characters that will fit in the buffer. So for a buffer of size n, the program can write only n-1 characters into the buffer. This guarantees that the buffer will contain only the number of characters possible, without overwriting other data.
